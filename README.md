# hello-world

Hello everyone!
My name is Kai-Andre S. Karlsen I'm currently attending Nannestad Upper Secondary School at the Information technology course. I'm working towards getting my professional trainee starting next year. I'm particularly interested in computer assembly and IT Operations and Management. I'm also competent within the areas of programming. In our first year we also covered areas of media production where I worked with Adobe Creative Cloud programs producing work in areas like film, photo editing, graphic design and more.
